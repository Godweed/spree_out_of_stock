===============

Simple extension that historically stores when a Product ran out of stock.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_out_of_stock', github: 'rogelio-meza-t/spree_out_of_stock'
  ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler:

  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_out_of_stock:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.


## Usage

1. Go to the reports section in the admin dashboard.

2. Select from the displayed list the option `Out of Stock`.

3. Choose a date range of your preference and hit `Search`.

4. The results are displayed as a simple table.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
cd spec/dummy
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
Then you can run test as follow

```shell
rspec
```
